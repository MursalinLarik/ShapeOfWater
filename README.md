# ShapeOfWater
Shape of Water is a civic innovation project aimed at resolving the water issues in the Megacity Karachi. We do so by first identifying the lack of existing maps of the water supply network. GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) is a device which captures B-scan radargrams of the underground 2D area. At the core of the project, we try to classify GPR radargrams at first then detect the pipes in the radargrams and then calculate their depth in subsurface. This information coupled with the embedded GPS location is visualized on a geographical map using QGIS. This CNNs, GAN models and digital image processing algorithms were used in the process to reach the end goal. 
First of all using the handcrafted digital image processing algorithm, following results were obtained:
