# ShapeOfWater
Shape of Water is civic innovation poject aimed at resolving the water issues in the megacity of Karachi. We do so by first identifying the lack of existing maps of the water supply network. GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) is a device which captures B-scan radargrams of the underground 2D area. At the core of the project, we try to detect the pipes in the radargrams and them calculate their depth. This information couple with the embedded GPS location is visualized on geographical map using QGIS.
